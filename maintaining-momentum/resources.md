**Living Cities, et al. “The Civic Tech and Data Collaborative Toolkit: Sustaining the Gain.” Medium. 2018.** [**https://medium.com/civic-tech-data-collaborative/the-ctdc-toolkit-sustaining-the-gain-632c813d16fe**](https://medium.com/civic-tech-data-collaborative/the-ctdc-toolkit-sustaining-the-gain-632c813d16fe)  **** &#x20;

**Reynoso, Elizabeth, Kathryn L.S. Pettit, and Christopher Whitaker. "Collaborating for 21st Century Solutions." The Urban Institute. June 19, 2018.**  [**https://www.urban.org/research/publication/collaborating-21st-century-solutions**](https://www.urban.org/research/publication/collaborating-21st-century-solutions)****

The Urban Institute provides a useful starting point for identifying philanthropic groups that have supported civic data initiatives and for developing strategies to diversify resources. The authors remind us that resources can be in a form other than a check and stress that managing “in-kind support for labor, space, data, or technology” will be key to civic data projects.
