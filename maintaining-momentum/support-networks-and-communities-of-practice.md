# Support Networks and Communities of Practice

In this guide, we've talked a lot about the community you work with locally: the people in your town, city, or region. But through your work, you are also part of other communities, distributed around the country and the world. These are groups of people -- whether library workers, data intermediaries, or others interested in aspects of civic data -- who form support networks and communities of practice. Library roles around local civic data are still emerging and evolving. Leaning on support networks for advice, examples, and inspiration can help you to maintain your work.

The Civic Switchboard project was designed, in part, to help facilitate a community of practice among people working to connect libraries with civic data in their local communities. We've hosted workshops and conference calls, written blog posts, and are working to get an online discussion group started. But in this part of our guide, we'd like to highlight some other relevant networks and communities you may wish to connect with or explore.

There are a number of groups that bring together data intermediaries. These organizations are varied and have published resources on civic data, hold conferences and webinars, or host mailing lists you can join. 

* \*\*\*\*[**National Neighborhood Indicators Partnership**](https://www.neighborhoodindicators.org/) **\(**NNIP**\)**
  * NNIP partner organizations are well-established data intermediaries that have positive and collaborative working relationships with a wide range of local institutions. The NNIP has made a rich set of resources available in the form of webinars and guides \(check out, for example, "[NNIP Lessons on Local Data Sharing](https://www.neighborhoodindicators.org/library/guides/nnip-lessons-local-data-sharing)" and "[Guide for Community Training on Data and Technology](https://www.neighborhoodindicators.org/library/catalog/guide-community-training-data-and-technology)"\).
* \*\*\*\*[**Community Indicators Consortium** ](https://communityindicators.net/)**\(CIC\)**
  * Community indicators "are measures that refer to population groups rather than individuals. \(They indicate what’s happening at the community level, rather than the individual level.\)" \([University of Kansas, Community Tool Box](https://ctb.ku.edu/en/table-of-contents/evaluate/evaluate-community-initiatives/examples-of-community-level-indicators/main)\). The CIC  is a group focused on supporting availability and use of community indicators. Visit the [CIC Toolbox ](https://communityindicators.net/knowledge/)for resources and events.
