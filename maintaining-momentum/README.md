# Maintaining Momentum

We've been using the metaphor of the ecosystem throughout this guide. While ecosystems are dynamic and can be expected to change, they also require care to stay healthy and sustainable. 

In this section, we look at ways that libraries can sustain their roles in civic data ecosystems. It can be a real challenge to continuously energize, build, and fund libraries in civic data work.  Building partnerships, joint projects and institutionalizing the roles are strategies to share the challenge  and maintain momentum.
