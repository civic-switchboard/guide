# Providence Public Library, Providence, RI

**Partner organizations:** NEXMAP, Chibitronics \(non-profit civic tech organization\)

**Library roles played:** [Developing civic data literacy](../library-roles/developing-civic-data-literacy.md), [Showing the importance of Civic Data](../library-roles/showing-importance-civic-data.md)

**The Providence team worked with consultants to develop teen-focused paper circuit data visualization workshops to complement a larger data literacy initiative. The workshops took a unique approach to data literacy by promoting hands-on learning for a hard to reach audience. The library hopes to apply this workshop model to other opportunities with community partners.**

Data Fluency is emerging as a recognized learning competency thanks to the ubiquity of networked technologies and computational platforms. With more and more job skills requiring hands-on use of technology and data skills, it is more important than ever to make data something that resonates with young learners. 

Providence Public Library sought to address this through its [Data Navigators 2.0](https://www.provlib.org/education/teen-squad/data-navigators-2-0/) program, which guides teens through learning data analytics basics, including 1\) posing a question 2\) collecting relevant data 3\) cleaning the data using spreadsheet software 4\) visualizing that data using Tableau and 5\) analyzing data for insightful trends and correlations.

The pilot group, high school students from a local charter school, found it difficult to relate to the course material as working with data can be very abstract. By developing complementary ways for students to gain introductory data exploration skills - using not only screens and computational tools but craft techniques and physical materials - we sought to help learners find more concrete, visual, and hands-on ways to understand data and relevant topics. 

Project partner [NEXMAP](http://www.nexmap.org/) works with multimodal literacies that blend traditional literacies with 21st century techniques, tools, and methods, making use of paper crafts and hands-on circuitry alongside more technical data analysis tools. We provided a “push-in” activity for the introductory course on Tableau offered in the Data Navigators 2.0 program. This supplemental “making” activity used paper and electronics \(including components from expressive technology [Chibitronics](https://chibitronics.com/)\) to make data explorations more accessible and translatable for learners new to data encounters. NEXMAP \(based in California\) provided coaching and logistical support during the program with initial Skype sessions and a mid-semester site visit. 

Teens weren’t the only ones who were excited to utilize their art skills and create functioning circuits. NEXMAP also hosted an adult professional development workshop on paper circuitry, and many of the attendees were highly engaged and interested in learning more about these tools. The experience was engaging and useful as an accessible way to explore and share data findings. The teens’ craft projects - which used light as an output to evoke aspects of a dataset - served as a highly effective supplement to their data work. 

Throughout the program, we were really pleased to see how quickly and competently staff and students were able to learn and master basic techniques for creating simple circuit systems. We could see how effective this kind of project can be when participants are doing pre-work and exploration work with data, taking an active role in researching and exploring datasets as a way to develop a lens on a chosen topic. These “making” projects helped motivate the students, and served as a great learning tool to help them grasp data visualization concepts. Overall, this project brought new expertise and exposure to new skills to Providence Public Library, and will help us continue to iterate, broaden, and grow our data literacy programming. 

In the future, we would be interested in exploring different local data sources, and spending more time with the adult Data Pathway learners. We would like to see civic data and paper circuitry used with middle school-aged youth as an onboarding tool to our teen coding and data analytics classes. We are in conversation with the National Writing Project regarding their out-of-school literacy work on argumentation and libraries. This kind of co-creation work with community partners, which combines domain expertise on a dataviz platform and a literacy/information design and communications experience, holds potential for a sustainable open data teaching and learning initiative for libraries as an outreach and civic engagement project.
