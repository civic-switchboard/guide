This document reports on a series of interviews with data intermediaries exploring the current state of the civic tech field and its potential to prompt change for the lives of low-income people. The report defines civic tech as "the use of technology by cities for service provision, civic engagement, and data analysis to inform decision making." Living Cities found that interview participants saw both promise and limitations in civic tech; limitations include resource constraints that affect local governments' experimentation with civic tech and the frequent poor reach of civic tech tools.
