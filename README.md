# Introduction

Welcome to the _Civic Switchboard Guide_, a living document designed to help libraries become more engaged in their local civic data ecosystems. This work is the product of an Institute for Museum and Library Services funded project called [Civic Switchboard: Connecting Libraries and Community Information Networks](https://civic-switchboard.github.io/). 

We believe that strong partnerships between libraries and other local civic data intermediaries better serve data users, further democratize data, and support equitable access to information. This guide aims to support libraries and civic data intermediaries to establish and grow these partnerships. Over the project's two-year period, this guide will evolve as we gather lessons about roles and relationships from civic data partners in the field.

## What you'll find in this guide

This document is modular in nature, with practical guidance and case studies. It will help library workers and their data partners to:

* identify local needs and contexts for open civic data
* consider roles, practices, and governance in a regional civic data ecosystem
* find pathways for including libraries into civic partnerships
* anticipate and address common challenges encountered when helping the public apply and use open data
* measure the  health and capacity of local ecosystems
* promote use of data in alignment with community-based concerns
* learn from examples of successful civic data partnerships

## What you won't find in this guide

Our focus is on developing library roles and relationships around data in their communities, so we won't cover very general topics like "what is open data", nor very specific ones like "how to archive local community data sets". The good news is that many other people have created excellent guides and reports on topics like these! We'll point to many of these related resources in this guide.

## About the Civic Switchboard project

The authors of this guide are part of regional partnership in Pittsburgh that brings together a public library system \([Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh](https://www.carnegielibrary.org/)\), an academic library system \([University of Pittsburgh Library System](https://www.library.pitt.edu/)\), and a regional open data portal \([Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center](http://www.wprdc.org/), hosted by the University of Pittsburgh Center for Social and Urban Research\). We are joined by a national membership organization of non-library civic data intermediaries, [the National Neighborhood Indicators Partnership](https://github.com/civic-switchboard/guide/tree/6d474c8c5966f7d2c5234b10e15626af6f15b288/National%20Neighborhood%20Indicators%20Partnership/README.md), coordinated by [the Urban Institute](https://www.urban.org/). The team members include Aaron Brenner \(PI\), Bob Gradeck, Toby Greenwalt, Eleanor Mattern, Liz Monk \(Project Manager\), Kathy Pettit, and Eleanor Tutt.

In Pittsburgh, our local civic data ecosystem is unique in that both public and academic librarians are actively involved as data intermediaries, and they work in close collaboration with other civic data publishers and users. Our librarians regularly partner with local governments, non-library intermediaries, civic organizations, student organizations, and data users in a variety of ways. They play a number of roles, including helping people discover civic information, building data literacy and technical skills, providing technical assistance in data management and documentation, creating feedback mechanisms to publishers, convening and hosting events, and connecting data users. Our experience shows that libraries and librarians should act as data intermediaries and play key roles in the continuing development of civic open data. Their expertise provides insights on a wide range of issues that affect both data publishers and users.

Many of our colleagues elsewhere, including librarians and other civic data intermediaries, have asked us how they can develop similar relationships and roles for librarians in their home communities. This guide is developed in response to this interest and expression of need.
