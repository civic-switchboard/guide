# Introduction

Welcome to the _Civic Switchboard Guide_, a living document designed to help libraries become more engaged in their civic data ecosystem.This guide is the product of an Institute for Museum and Library Services funded project called [Civic Switchboard](https://civic-switchboard.github.io/). This project encourages partnerships between libraries and local civic data intermediaries in order to better serve data users, further democratize data, and support equitable access to information. This guide aims to empower libraries and civic data intermediaries to establish and grow these partnerships. Over the project's two year period, this guide will develop and evolve as we gather lessons from civic data partners in the field.

The authors of this guide are part of regional partnership in Pittsburgh that brings together a public library system, an academic library system, and a civic data intermediary. In Pittsburgh, our local civic data ecosystem is unique in that both public and academic librarians are actively involved as data intermediaries, and they work in close collaboration with other civic data publishers and users. Librarians regularly partner with local governments, non-library intermediaries, civic organizations, student organizations, and data users in a variety of ways. They play a number of roles, including helping people discover civic information, building data literacy and technical skills, providing technical assistance in data management and documentation, creating feedback mechanisms to publishers, convening and hosting events, and connecting data users. Our experience shows that libraries and librarians should be key actors in the continuing development of civic open data portals and act as core data intermediaries; their expertise adds value to a wide range of issues that affect both data publishers and users.

Many of our colleagues elsewhere, including librarians and other established civic data intermediaries, have asked us how they can develop similar relationships and roles for librarians in their home communities. This guide is developed in response to this interest and expression of need.

### What you'll find in this guide

This guide is divided into five sections. 



This resource will help library workers to:

* identify local needs and contexts around open civic data

* consider roles, practices, and governance in a regional civic data ecosystem

* anticipate and address common challenges data intermediaries may encounter as they help the public to apply and use open data

* measure local civic open data health and capacity

* promote use of data in alignment with community-based concerns

* learn from examples of successful civic data partnerships
