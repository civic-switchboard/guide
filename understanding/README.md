# Understanding

We designed the Civic Switchboard project around two strong convictions: 

First, **cultivating a healthy local civic data ecosystem depends upon the coordinated efforts of a variety of data intermediaries**. In other words, no single entity can effectively cover all of the necessary roles. Cultivating and strengthening data intermediary partnerships is a core objective of this project.

Secondly, we believe in **the importance of local context. The variety of local civic data landscapes means that no single model can be made to fit every city or region**. This can be seen, for example, across the network of [National Neighborhood Indicators Partnership data intermediaries](https://www.neighborhoodindicators.org/partners/about-our-partners). Because each communityâ€™s civic data ecosystem is unique, the structure of local data intermediaries take different shapes. Proposing models for library involvement in civic data at the national level involves capturing a wide variety of successful local practices.

Driven by these values, we begin our guide with a section to help you understand the unique characteristics of _**your own civic data ecosystem**_. In this section, you'll learn more about data intermediaries, and we'll share some techniques you can use to gain a deeper understanding what is already happening in your local context. We recommend that you start here, because we believe that gaining some understanding is a prerequisite for engagement -- our next section.
