## **Understanding Civic Open Data**

* Living Cities. "Field Scan of Civic Technology." November 26, 2012. [https://www.livingcities.org/resources/131-field-scan-of-civic-technology](https://www.livingcities.org/resources/131-field-scan-of-civic-technology)

This document reports on a series of interviews with data intermediaries exploring the current state of the civic tech field and its potential to prompt change for the lives of low-income people. The report defines civic tech as "the use of technology by cities for service provision, civic engagement, and data analysis to inform decision making." Living Cities found that interview participants saw both promise and limitations in civic tech; limitations include resource constraints that affect local governments' experimentation with civic tech and the frequent poor reach of civic tech tools.

* Pew Research Center. “Americans’ Views on Open Government Data.” April 2015. [http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/21/open-government-data/](http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/21/open-government-data/)

This report presents findings from a 2014 survey investigating public awareness and perception of open data initiatives in the United States. The survey finds that two-thirds of respondents have used the internet for connect with the government in some way \(for example, looking for information about the government and completing a transaction\). The Pew Research Center found that Americans have "mixed hopes" about the potential of open data for improving government performance. This report provides readers with definitions of open government and open data and a look at how individuals are currently engaging with civic information online.

## **Ecosystem Mapping and Health**

* Malinsky, Eli and Chad Lubelsky. "Network Evaluation: Cultivating Healthy Networks for Social Change." Toronto: Centre for Social Innovation. [http://socialinnovation.ca/sites/socialinnovation.ca/files/NetworkEvaluation\_Pocket\_english.pdf](http://socialinnovation.ca/sites/socialinnovation.ca/files/NetworkEvaluation_Pocket_english.pdf)

Malinsky and Lubelsky define networks as "systems of relatively autonomous actors that are working in concern to achieve shared goals or pursuing individual goals within a shared system" \(p. 8\). Their text offers strategies for evaluating the performance and success of networks.

* The Open Data Barometer. [https://opendatabarometer.org](https://opendatabarometer.org)

A project of the World Wide Web Foundation, the Open Data Barometer assesses the "prevalence and impact of open data initiatives around the world," ranking national governments on the implementation and effects of their programs.

* Open Data Institute \(UK\). "Mapping Data Ecosystems." March 23, 2018. [https://theodi.org/article/mapping-data-ecosystems/](https://theodi.org/article/mapping-data-ecosystems/)

This resources offers guidance on mapping an ecosystem in a workshop setting or by oneself or with a small number of colleagues. It identifies common players in an data ecosystems, provides prompts for creating a map, and highlights examples of data ecosystem maps.

* Donker, Frederika Well and Bastiaan van Loenen. "How to Assess the Success of the Open Data Ecosystem?" \_International Journal of Digital Earth \_10, no. 3 \(2017\): 284-306.

Donker and van Loenen review existing frameworks for assessing the health and efficacy of open data initiatives and identify a need to capture greater data user feedback through assessment. They offer a "holistic open data assessment framework" that examines data supply \("the way in which data are provided as open data"\), data governance \("the way in which government aspects are organised"\) and user characteristics \("the way in which the user characteristics enable the user to innovate with open data"\) \(p. 288\).
