# Ways of thinking about data: Open Data, Civic Data

We said in our introduction that our guide is not a primer on Open Data. That's true, and we recommend a number of [other resources](../resources.md) that do a good job covering the nitty-gritty of Open Data. Here we offer just a little information about some terms that we often use, and ways that they represent slightly different concepts.

**Open Data** generally describes data that are free to access, use, and reuse by anybody for any purpose; are available in a usable, often machine-readable formats; and which can be modified and shared by others. The great accessibility and permissive use of open data make it very appealing. But these same factors mean that substantial investments are often needed to prepare, describe, and reliably publish such data. Openness can also be in conflict with privacy and ethical issues that surround certain types of data.  

Although we may assume that open data are electronic and web-accessible, much of it is not. There's plenty of data on paper, such as data published in print reports. And, in many cases when these kinds of publications are available digitally, the data is still contained in a table inside a PDF, or may only be distributed on physical media such as DVD or CD. From a practical point of view, this is not [truly web-accessible open data](https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/REC-dwbp-20170131/) and may have limited usefulness to the public.

It's also important to note that open data as a concept is not associated with any one domain. However, two of the most prominent categories of open data are 1\) [research ](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618)and [science](https://mozillascience.github.io/open-data-primers/index.html), and 2\) [government ](https://opendatapolicyhub.sunlightfoundation.com/why-open-data/)and [civic data](https://www.alliedmedia.org/files/ddjc_zine-final-rgb.pdf).

So, let's move on to **Civic Data**, which is the focus of the Civic Switchboard project. We like the term civic data because it is information that describes the context of our communities. Civic data can include not only data produced by governmental organizations, but also non-profits, civic institutions \(like libraries!\), and other community-based organizations. Data created by or about individuals is also in scope; such data can powerfully represent alternative perspectives and stories. Sometimes law or policy requires that certain civic data be open to the public. However, not all civic data is open data. Sometimes that's because of the need to protect privacy or legitimately confidential information. Other times, it's because there aren't enough resources allocated to do the work required to prepare, describe, and publish the data. And, in some cases, civic data is legally 'open' but, because of access procedures and format, not practically 'open'.
