# Selected Resources

On this page, we've selected and described some resources that we think are most relevant to the "Engaging" section. You can also find a comprehensive list of the references cited throughout the entire guide on the [Guide Resources](https://civic-switchboard.gitbook.io/guide/guide-resources) page.

**Center for Community Health and Development at the University of Kansas.  "Creating and Maintaining Partnerships." part of Community Tool Box.** [**https://ctb.ku.edu/en/creating-and-maintaining-partnerships**](https://ctb.ku.edu/en/creating-and-maintaining-partnerships)\*\*\*\*

The skills and techniques of building community partnerships are not unique to libraries and other data intermediaries. This toolkit, part of a larger resource supporting community-based work, gives specific, practical guidance on developing and maintaining partnerships.

**Headd, Mark. \(n.d.\). How to Talk to Civic Hackers.**[ **https://www.civichacking.guide/**](https://www.civichacking.guide/)\*\*\*\*

Mark Headd, the former Chief Data Officer for the City of Philadelphia,  focuses on slightly different, but adjacent, kind of partnership: government employees collaborating with volunteer technology groups. There is plenty of relevant and detailed information for libraries and data partners here; in particular you may want to look at the [Strategies for Engagement](https://www.civichacking.guide/strategies_for_engagement.html) section.
