# Common Barriers to Getting Started

 **Negotiating boundaries**

When there are multiple players in the field \(or in your own library\) it is important to understand the roles of other organizations.  Some resources to better understand and/or plan to work with other local organizations include: [Finding partners in your ecosystem](finding-a-data-intermediary-partne.md); [Library roles](https://app.gitbook.com/@civic-switchboard/s/guide/library-roles); [Mapping your ecosystem](../understanding-your-ecosystem/mapping-your-ecosystem.md); [Developing project plan for work](https://github.com/civic-switchboard/guide/raw/master/toolkit/Civic%20Switchboard%20Activity%20Canvas%20Updated%20May%202%202018.pdf).

**Lack of urgency**

With constraints on time and  resources, you might find that some in your organization view building the library’s civic data capacity as a low priority.  There are ways to advocate for action and make a case for engagement: [Finding resources to support civic data work](../maintaining-momentum/finding-resources-for-your-engagement.md).

**Building trust and credibility for the library in the civic data space** 

Libraries may be new to the civic data space and other entities may not  know what new role the library intends. Some ways for the library to become a trusted participant in the field might be: Library[ ](https://app.gitbook.com/@civic-switchboard/s/guide/library-roles)roles; [Mapping your ecosystem](../understanding-your-ecosystem/mapping-your-ecosystem.md); Community user needs.

**Potential negative consequences from publicly available data**

Open and civic data can be confusing - both in how it is defined and how it may be used. Transparency and clarity about your library’s goals, processes, partnerships can help quell fears about what might be done with open civic data.  Some resources include: [Ways of thinking about data](../context-and-concepts/ways-of-thinking-about-data-open-data-civic-data.md); [8 considerations for Libraries that want to host open data](https://civic-switchboard.github.io/post_14/); Community user needs; [Mapping your ecosystem](../understanding-your-ecosystem/mapping-your-ecosystem.md).

**Maintaining momentum** 

It can a real challenge to continuously energize, build, and fund libraries in civic data work.  Building partnerships, joint projects and institutionalizing the roles are strategies to share the challenge  and maintain momentum. You might find resources in: [Finding resources to support civic data work](../maintaining-momentum/finding-resources-for-your-engagement.md); [Library roles;](https://app.gitbook.com/@civic-switchboard/s/guide/library-roles) and [Building libraries into civic data partnerships](building-libraries-into-civic-data-partnerships.md).

**Finding capacity** 

Related to lack of urgency, civic data work isn’t always top priority as a place to expend capacity.  Starting small, proof of concept can help build the momentum and prove that putting time and capacity into the work is worthwhile. Check out: [Building partnerships into civic data partnerships](building-libraries-into-civic-data-partnerships.md); [Mapping your ecosystem](../understanding-your-ecosystem/mapping-your-ecosystem.md); [Finding resources to support civic data work](../maintaining-momentum/finding-resources-for-your-engagement.md)

**Lacking authority to create or encourage to create a single network.**  

Take your time, build trust.  Remember that you don’t have to be the authority.  Check out [mapping your ecosystem ](../understanding-your-ecosystem/mapping-your-ecosystem.md)to see how players are \(and aren’t\) working together and this [one sheeter](../toolkit/) to remind you why the library has a real role to play in this work. 

**Feeling unqualified**

You aren’t! There are many  roles the library can play when  stepping into in this space. Check out [Library Roles](https://app.gitbook.com/@civic-switchboard/s/guide/library-roles) where we outline why libraries fit right in to civic data ecosystems.
