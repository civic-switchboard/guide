# Finding Partners in Your Ecosystem

### First, look for data intermediaries 

Our first recommendation is that you look for partners among other **data intermediaries** in your ecosystem \[_see guide section_ [_Defining a Data Intermediary_](../understanding/defining-a-data-intermediary.md)\]. Why? Because data intermediaries are natural allies to libraries, perform similar and complementary roles, and usually have a broad understanding of your local community data and user needs.

Here are a set of recommendations for identifying a data intermediary in your city or region: 

* **National Neighborhood Indicators Partnership**: One starting point, particularly if you are in an urban area, is to check for a local partner of the National Neighborhood Indicators Partnership \(NNIP\). NNIP is a collaboration between the [Urban Institute](https://www.urban.org/) and organizations focused on connecting people with community data \(in the interest of full disclosure, NNIP is a partner on the project that is producing this guide\). NNIP partner organizations are well-established data intermediaries that have positive and collaborative working relationships with a wide range of local institutions. Check the [list of NNIP partners](https://www.neighborhoodindicators.org/partners/profiles) to see whether you have one in your area. Even if there is no NNIP partner in your immediate region, your nearest one may have recommendations on organizations in your area that are fulfilling data intermediately functions.

If there is no NNIP partner in your area, there are other offices and organizations that are likely working as an intermediary \(at least in part\) and might serve as initial contact points. Consider reaching out to:

* **Local government**: Your city and county governments collect and use data – all day, every day – and they may even be making it public! If you have a connection with someone who works in local government, ask for their thoughts on ways to connect. Some other offices/positions that would be likely suspects include: designated open data team members, [chief data officers](https://datasmart.ash.harvard.edu/news/article/data-leadership-at-the-executive-level-761), planning departments, Geographic Information System \(GIS\) staff; 
* **Academic institutions** often engage with civic data and community partner groups through research, community service and coursework. If you already know somebody at a local university - engage them first and ask for their assistance connecting with their network. Potential contacts at a nearby university may be found in urban research centers, community engagement and extension offices, and schools, programs, and departments that use civic data \(Information Science, Public Health, Social Work, Public Policy, and others\);
* **Civic Tech groups in your region**: Many cities have a local brigade in the [Code for American network](https://brigade.codeforamerica.org/) or other informal community-oriented technology groups. Search for some combination of "civic," "data," and "tech" on [Meetup ](https://www.meetup.com/)or [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/);
* **The State Data Center Program** is a partnership between each state, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, island areas, and the U.S. Census Bureau. The Data Center program makes data available to the public through state agencies, libraries, and regional and local governments. A [list of participating agencies](https://www.census.gov/about/partners/sdc/member-network.html) can be found on the Census Bureau's website;
* **Local nonprofits or civic organizations** often work with data to inform outreach, target practices, and better know the communities they serve. Local foundations may also be supporting data work to support local nonprofits and could have insight into the local civic data scene.

### If you can't find other data intermediaries

If you have explored your civic data ecosystem and found that there is not a lot happening in your area, that's OK. You have the opportunity to start something extraordinary. You can start to bring people together to talk about data with an eye toward developing shared best practices. One way to bring people together involves inviting a speaker from a nearby community knee-deep in data intermediaries. Or, hold an open data conversation to connect with potential allies. You might even consider holding a training session on federal data tools, or an informal hack night using whatever community data is available to you. These types of actions and activities will help you see who else is interested in using civic data in your community, and \(importantly\) give you a chance to grab their contact information. These types of convenings may also reveal some players/things going on that you missed in your original scan.
