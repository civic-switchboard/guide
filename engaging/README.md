# Engaging

The previous section, _Understanding_, was meant to give you a solid grounding in what's happening in your local civic data ecosystem. Now, keeping that local context in mind, we'd like to help you establish relationships that will lead to action. 

One of the first engagements you may need to make is with your own organization, about the relevancy and value of library invovlement in civic data work. We offer strategies and examples of what has been successful in other places.

Next, we encourage you to build on your ecosystem mapping to identify potential civic data partners for libraries. We give you a list of people and groups to look for, and guidance on how to talk with them about developing partnerships.
