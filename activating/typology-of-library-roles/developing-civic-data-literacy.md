# Showing the importance of civic data

**What's the need?**

* Many people aren't aware of what civic data is, how it can be used, and how it is relevant to them.

**Why the library?**  

* The library supports broad and diverse audiences, many of whom may not be included in conventional discussions around data.
* Libraries are physical spaces for sharing activities, projects, and stories from the broader community

**What you can do:**

* Promote, through storytelling and case studies, projects that use civic data
* Host data art installations, speaker series, data book clubs
