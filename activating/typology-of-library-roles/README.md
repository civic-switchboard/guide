# Library Roles in Civic Data Ecosystems

Throughout this guide you've read why we believe libraries should be **key actors in civic open data ecosystems.** 

In practice, that role can take many forms. The specifics will \(and _should_\) be different in different regions. But at the core is the goal of helping people find, use, and apply public information.

In this section, we've gathered some of the main roles we believe libraries and library workers can play. Some might resonate with your local ecosystem, some may not. In any case, we hope you'll find something inspiring within this list. Click through each topic for more details and examples!
