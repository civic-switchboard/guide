# Connecting data producers

**What's the need?**

* Data producers, even when working in the same region, are often separated. Data producers may be facing similar problems, and may have solutions or complementary expertise to share.
* Together, data producers can develop solutions for challenges around data governance, data publishing and sharing; they can advocate for infrastructure; and they can standardize the descriptions and availability of their data.

**Why the library?**  

* As a community hub and an advocate for the social good, your library has the capacity to act as a convener and a bridge between networks. 
* Libraries have a special opportunity to include local groups that don’t traditionally see themselves as belonging to the data space.   

**What you can do:**

* Convene a data producers council / working group
* Host ecosystem mapping events that bring together local data producers 
* Hold workshops for organizations interested in publishing data. Topics could include data management, metadata, and privacy 

**Inspiration:**

* Charlotte Case Study \(coming soon\)
* Pioneer Case Study \(coming soon\)
