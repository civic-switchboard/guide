# Creating civic data

**What's the need?**

* As you advocate for sharing data, you should set an example by sharing it yourself  
* Data about your library can help better inform community context
* Historic information that could be used as data is often held in library collections, but not in machine-readable form
* People want to collect and create data themselves but often need support. Not everyone has specialized tools \(such as air quality monitors\) to aid in data collection. ****

**Why the library?**  

* Your library likely collects data for annual reporting that could also be of interest for public use. 
* Libraries have a long tradition of reformatting materials to support different forms of use, including microfilming and digitizing collections. Creating datasets from collections is a continuation of this work.
* Libraries have the infrastructure for loaning equipment \(like air quality monitors\) and can reach a broad and diverse audience.

**What you can do:**

* [Create and publish](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/a-community-profile-of-pittsburgh-neighborhoods-1974) machine-readable datasets from library collections, resources, or operational data
* Loan equipment for citizen science data collection

**Resources you can use:**

* Always Already Computational - Collections as Data**:** This project has many resources and examples to inspire considering library collections as/containing data. A good starting place is their ["50 Things" you can do list](https://collectionsasdata.github.io/fiftythings/). 
* SciStarter: "[Calling all Librarians: Citizen Science Day 2019 Invitation](https://blog.scistarter.com/2019/01/citizen-science-day-2019-invitation/)"
