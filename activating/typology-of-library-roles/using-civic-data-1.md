# Using Civic Data

**What's the need?**

* Civic data can help libraries to better understand the communities they serve in order to make more informed decisions about collections, staff, and programming

**Why the library?**  

* Libraries are already data-driven organizations and collect internal data on how collections and spaces are used. 
* If the library is advocating for the importance of civic data it is vital to demonstrate its importance at home.  Be the change...

**What you can do:**

* Public Libraries: Use Census data to create demographic profiles of the communities you serve; consider languages spoken, education levels, income, and employment
* Incorporating civic data into reporting can model great open data practices for patrons and the broader community. 
* Consult state or municipal open data for data sources that can help you make your case for an upcoming grant or new library initiative.
