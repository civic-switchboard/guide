This guide introduces the Tactical Data Engagement \(TDE\) method that intermediaries and civic data producers may adopt "to actively help residents use open data to better their communities." TDE is conceptualized as a four-step design-oriented process for 1.\) _finding_ a focus area for community use of open data; 2.\) _refining_ the use case; 3.\) _designing_ a plan for an intervention to support the use case; and 4.\) _implementing_ the plan.
