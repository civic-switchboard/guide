On this page, we've selected and described some resources that we think are most relevant to the "Activating" section. You can also find a comprehensive list of the references cited throughout the entire guide on the [Guide Resources](https://civic-switchboard.gitbook.io/guide/guide-resources) page.

This guide introduces the Tactical Data Engagement \(TDE\) method that intermediaries and civic data producers may adopt "to actively help residents use open data to better their communities." TDE is conceptualized as a four-step design-oriented process for 1.\) _finding_ a focus area for community use of open data; 2.\) _refining_ the use case; 3.\) _designing_ a plan for an intervention to support the use case; and 4.\) _implementing_ the plan.
