# Typology of Library Roles

The Civic Switchboard project is premised on the idea that libraries' work and partnerships should be responsive to the needs and opportunities in their unique civic data ecosystems. Here, we highlight some of the varied roles and activities that the Civic Switchboard project team has observed libraries performing:

* Metadata consultations
* Privacy advice
* Data management planning
* Data archiving and preservation
* Creating data user guides
* Library as data publisher
* Cultivating the civic data ecosystem
* Facilitating community conversations
* Hosting community events
* Helping to establish publishing priorities
* User engagement and feedback
* Data literacy training
* Data skills training
* Providing technical assistance
* Infrastructure for data collection 
* Promotion \(social media, events, calendars\)
* Storytelling
