# Typology of Library Roles

The Civic Switchboard project is premised on the idea that libraries' work and partnerships should be responsive to the needs and opportunities in their unique civic data ecosystems. Here, we highlight some of the varied roles and activities that the Civic Switchboard project team has observed libraries performing:

* Consulting with civic data stakeholders on
  * metadata for datasets and portals
  * technical infrastructure for repositories
  * privacy and strategies to protect it
  * agreements for data sharing
  * data management planning
  * publishing priorities
* Authoring [data user guides](http://www.wprdc.org/data-user-guides/) for civic data
  * for specific datasets, to provide important context and scenarios for use
  * on broader topics, to showcase the range of available data and how it might be used together
* Archiving and preserving civic data
  * in a library-managed repository
  * by performing curation tasks in partnership with an external repository
* [Creating and publishing](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/a-community-profile-of-pittsburgh-neighborhoods-1974) machine-readable datasets from library collections, resources, or operational data
