# Publishing civic data

**What's the need?**

* Many municipalities and regions have open data to share but need an institution to manage or coordinate a centralized data collection.

**Why the library?** &#x20;

* Libraries are trusted stewards of information and library workers have considerable expertise in managing data and protecting privacy.
* Libraries are leading many digital inclusion and data literacy efforts in their communities.&#x20;
* As the priorities of elected officials change, having a third-party entity like a library host data from government organizations and other partners can also help to sustain community data initiatives.&#x20;

**What you can do:**

* Publish available non-sensitive public information (ex. Census data) about your community&#x20;
* Build a prototype program using cloud-based data storage services like Dropbox, Box, or Google Drive to host data
* Manage a civic data portal

**Inspiration:**

* Chattanooga, TN: [Open Data portal](https://data.chattlibrary.org) hosted by the public library
* Albuquerque, NM: [Open Data infrastructure](https://www.cabq.gov/abq-data) using existing server infrastructure and simple protocols like FTP&#x20;
