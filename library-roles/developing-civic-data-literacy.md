# Developing civic data literacy

**What's the need?**

* There is an increasing need for people to strengthen data literacy skills within their job and career
* Many people would like to know how to better find and use civic data, and at the same time understand its context and limitations.

**Why the library?**  

* Your library likely has lots of experience teaching information literacy.  
* Your library is in the position to adapt existing services or information literacy curriculum to continue to help people access and make use of civic data.  

**What you can do:**

* Work with local community organizations to develop data literacy and skills training
* Tailor an existing data literacy training toolkit to local needs
* Fold data literacy into workforce development training workshops and programs
* Expand the roles and skill sets of library staff
