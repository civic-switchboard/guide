# Connecting data users

**What's the need?**

* Data users, even when living in the same region, are often separated. Users may be facing similar problems and may have solutions or complementary expertise to share.
* Together, data users can be stronger advocates for social change, for improving civic data, for making additional data available, and for the creation of tools to make data more useful.
* In-person connections can be fun and help strengthen local networks.

**Why the library?**  

* Your library is already a space for convening and connecting individuals to information.  
* Your library has the infrastructure and skills to build community around civic data. 

**What you can do:**

* Attend or host a civic data community event like a Data Day or a coding challenge 
* Promote civic data initiatives through the library's social media, events, and calendars
* Facilitate a local data user group around a specific dataset or topic \(ex. housing data, environmental data\)
* Host recurring data literacy trainings and workshops
