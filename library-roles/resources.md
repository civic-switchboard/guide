Proceedings of the 15th Annual International Conference on Digital Government Research, ACM.  pp. 17–23.** [**https://doi.org/10.1145/2612733.2612762**](https://doi.org/10.1145/2612733.2612762)

This paper considers essential infrastructure supporting a local information and data program and uses a case study approach to investigate roles for libraries in supporting the infrastructure and community data initiatives. Bertot, Butler, and Travis conduct 44 interviews in one mid-sized US city to understand data needs in community organizations and capacity within the library to engage in open data work.

Journal of the Urban and Regional Information Systems Association, volume 28, pp. 31-38.**[ **http://www.urisa.org/clientuploads/directory/Documents/Journal/Vol28\_final.pdf**](http://www.urisa.org/clientuploads/directory/Documents/Journal/Vol28_final.pdf)\*\*\*\*

Robinson and Mather describe an alignment between the mission of a public library and local government’s efforts to open data. They make the case that public libraries are well-positioned to serve as “civic data informediaries,” or “a person or organization that connects community members with open data so that public value can be derived from the data” \(p. 31\). Robinson and Mather’s article highlights examples of public libraries acting as civic infomediaries, including the [Edmonton Public Library](https://www.epl.ca/open-data/) and [Chattanooga Public Library](https://data.chattlibrary.org/).

This guide introduces the Tactical Data Engagement \(TDE\) method that intermediaries and civic data producers may adopt "to actively help residents use open data to better their communities." TDE is conceptualized as a four-step design-oriented process for 1.\) _finding_ a focus area for community use of open data; 2.\) _refining_ the use case; 3.\) _designing_ a plan for an intervention to support the use case; and 4.\) _implementing_ the plan.
