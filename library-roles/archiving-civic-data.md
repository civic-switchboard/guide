# Archiving civic data

**What's the need?**

* Open data publishers, whether individual organizations or aggregators, are often not built with long-term stewardship in mind. Specifically, they may not account for dataset versioning, digital preservation workflows and metadata, or a long-term commitment to data availability

**Why the library?** &#x20;

* Libraries have experience in preserving resources for future use, particularly items created by governments or other public entities.&#x20;

**What you can do:**

* Archive and preserve civic data in a library-managed repository or in partnership with an external repository.

**Inspiration:**

* United States: [Data Refuge](https://www.datarefuge.org)&#x20;
* United States: [End of Term Presidential Harvest](https://digital2.library.unt.edu/nomination/eth2016/about/)&#x20;
