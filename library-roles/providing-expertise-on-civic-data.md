# Providing expertise on data management

**What's the need?** 

* Many civic organizations produce data and need support with managing and versioning files, standardizing data-related practices, addressing data privacy, determining retention of data, sharing data appropriately, and more.
* Many data publishers \(such as managers of open data portals\) need support with metadata and vocabularies, format standards, technical infrastructure strategies, and more. 
* Many data users need strategies for personal data practices, including naming, labeling, storage, backups, deleting, and more. 

**Why the library?**  

* Library workers have the skills to provide data management and data hosting services to organizations that may not otherwise have internal capacity to treat their data as an asset. 

**What you can do:**

* Consult with data producers, publishers, and users on: 
  * Metadata used for datasets and data portals
  * Technical infrastructure for repositories
  * Data management planning
  * Protecting privacy when data sharing
