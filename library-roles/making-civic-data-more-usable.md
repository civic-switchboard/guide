# Making civic data more usable

**What's the need?**

* Data is often available but with barriers to use. Barriers include \(but are not limited to\) finding, obtaining, understanding, aggregating, applying, and contextualizing data.
* Data providers and intermediaries need insight from users to help prioritize open datasets and tool development.  

**Why the library?**  

* Your library has always helped to make existing information more usable and useful to its communities. 
* Library workers are uniquely positioned to know, communicate, and advocate for the information needs of their communities. 
* Library workers have expertise around the user experience of digital information. How do users prefer to search? To browse? To evaluate results for relevance? To download and use digital content? 

**What your library can do:**

* Author[ data user guides](http://www.wprdc.org/data-user-guides/) for specific datasets or on broader topics.
* Create views of data that meet specific needs, for user groups, social justice organizations. One example might be creating analog presentations of data for communities that are non-digital. 
* Partner with civic data initiatives to gather user feedback for improved services
