# Increasing  the library's capacity to do all of the above

**What's the need?**

* To be sustainable, many of the roles in this section require ongoing commitments of people, resources, and expertise.

**Why the library?**  

* Libraries are relatively stable organizations and are used to long-term planning and infrastructural thinking.

**What you can do:**

* Make the case about the importance of this work to your library's leadership and funders
* Determine what a baseline of civic data awareness might look like for you and your library colleagues; then work on developing it through whatever means works best in your library \(trainings, discussion groups, projects with community partners\)  
* Modify existing staff positions to include responsibilities around civic data; support people in these roles with training and meaningful project work
* Create and hire new positions with responsibilities around civic data
* Cross pollinate civic data conferences
