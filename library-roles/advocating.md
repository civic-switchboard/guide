# Advocating for ethical, responsible, and accessible civic data

**What's the need?**

* Civic data that is created through public funding should be well-known and easily accessible by the public. Realizing this often requires additional effort from data intermediaries.
* People appear in public datasets when they perform common activities such as obtaining a license, or making a 311 report. The public should be aware of how their activity is recorded and publicly distributed.
* The public interest in open data must be balanced with the protection of privacy

**Why the library?**  

* Libraries democratize access to information. This can and should apply to data too. 
* Libraries protect patron privacy to support broad accessibility to information and freedom of inquiry.

**What you can do:**

* Review how civic data is published in your region with an eye to access. Share what you find with civic data producers and publishers.
* Review how civic data is published in your region with an eye to personal privacy. Share what you find with civic data producers and publishers.
* Host workshops, speakers, film screenings, and other events that raise awareness of how individuals' personal traces might appear in civic data. Include guidance on protecting personal privacy.
