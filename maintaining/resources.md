Reynoso, Elizabeth, Kathryn L.S. Pettit, and Christopher Whitaker. "Collaborating for 21st Century Solutions." The Urban Institute. June 19, 2018.

The Urban Institute provides a useful starting point for identifying philanthropic groups that have supported civic data initiatives and for developing strategies to diversify resources. The authors remind us that resources can be in a form other than a check and stress that managing “in-kind support for labor, space, data, or technology” will be key to civic data projects.
