**Building Libraries into Civic Data Partnerships**

Libraries and civic data intermediaries are united in the type of work that they do: they help people find, use, and apply information. Similar values, goals, and missions create fertile ground for collaboration around civic data and an obvious opportunity to work together. We're sharing some of our observations on factors that have helped our collaboration in Pittsburgh. Collaborating can be challenging and we’re eager to gather information from other regional partners about what has been useful to support your work together!

Our partnership in Pittsburgh involves three organizations: the [Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center ](https://www.wprdc.org/)\(our team’ s civic data intermediary\), the [Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh](https://www.carnegielibrary.org/), and the[ University Library System at the University of Pittsburgh](https://www.library.pitt.edu/).Through this collaboration, we have worked together on joint projects \(like Civic Switchboard!\), organized events in the region, engaged in information sharing and brainstorming, and connected our user groups with the partner organizations.



**Connecting to Your Library’s Mission**

Collaborating across institutions usually requires some organizational permission or, at minimum, not getting blocked by your own organization leadership. Your library's leaders also might need to be on board if they are going to allocate resources -- like your time! -- to the work. If you can articulate how partnerships around civic data connect directly to your library's mission and values, you'll have a better chance of getting the buy-in and support that you need.

Every organization is a little different, and so the strategy of connecting the civic data work you want to do to your library's mission will be specific to you. Here's what it looked like for us:

Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh \(CLP\) recognizes data literacy is an increasingly important literacy for our staff and community to cultivate. Civic data partnerships are a core part of CLP's Beyond Big Data, a multiyear initiative together with the people of Pittsburgh to activate and amplify our collective ability to use data to understand and improve our lives and communities. The importance of data work, partnerships, and civic participation are woven throughout the six areas of focus of CLP's [2018-2022 Strategic Plan](https://www.carnegielibrary.org/about/strategic-plan/). For example, our “Inclusive and Equitable” area of focus has a goal of promoting digital inclusion and facilitating fluency, our "Informative and Empowering” area includes the commitment to inform the community on privacy rights and the reliability of information, and all six areas emphasize the importance of community data to aid in planning and evaluation and the knowledge that our library is something we all do together.

For the University Library System, civic data partnerships align with both the goals of the University of Pittsburgh and the aims outlined in the library’s long range plan. In the [2016-2020 Strategic Plan for Pitt](https://www.pitt.edu/sites/default/files/Strategic-Plan-Presentation.pdf), one of the five top-level strategic goals is to strengthen our communities“from the Pitt community, to our region, and the world around us\[,\] by expanding engagements, enriching connections, and embracing a global perspective.” In the [University Library System Long Range Plan for 2014-2017](https://www.library.pitt.edu/other/files/pdf/about/LRP14-17.pdf)  includes a commitment to growing community strength through relationships that support the stewardship and discoverability of information about Pittsburgh and the region. By working with the WPRDC and CLP, the University Library System connected with a project that has regional impact and that supports the preservation and accessibility of regional information.

To communicate the value of the partnership and your civic data work with your administration, look to your organization’s mission and goals. Situate your collaboration within these guiding tenets and get your organization on board!



**Playing Distinct Roles**

While commonalities in missions and goals provide a valuable starting point for collaboration, differences are equally critical. We believe strong teams have a variety of perspectives and skills, connect to different audiences, and also share resources. With our collaboration in Pittsburgh, our team brings together backgrounds and skills in digital libraries, GIS, data management, preservation, metadata creation, and community outreach. Each partner reaches a different audience and has access to different physical spaces. We pool our resources with the common aim of helping people find, use, and apply civic information about the Pittsburgh region. The roles of the academic and the public library have been distinct in this collaboration; the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh’s work has focused on increasing awareness of and access to WPRDC data throughout the community while simultaneously offering opportunities for data literacy learning across all age groups, and the University Library System at Pitt has worked closely with the WPRDC on metadata and data management. 



**Experiencing Mutual Benefits**

Our collaboration in Pittsburgh has allowed each organization to develop capacity and to experience individual benefits. When the University Library System began working with the WPRDC, it was at a time when the organization was growing its data management services and extending expertise in metadata and vocabularies into a University-facing metadata service. By working with the WPRDC, University Library System team members were able to build capacity in these areas, while providing assistance to the data portal and documentation. CLP has been able to leverage WPRDC’s data infrastructure to publish open Library data as a community partner without the development and awareness building costs associated with creating a portal from scratch. Additionally, high profile events such as [Data Day](https://www.livingcities.org/blog/1226-pittsburgh-s-data-day-using-civic-data-to-spark-hands-on-community-engagement) hosted by CLP in partnership with WPRDC, have been successful because they combine the perspectives, skills, and audiences of both our organizations as well as ULS and other partners within the larger civic tech and data ecosystem.

One of the [core observations](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VO6GGw7e7gN4lXHFeNnZcfVQsal-SZPS_0DbBCxgZAk/edit#slide=id.gdb13b5fad_0_107) that informs the WPRDC work is that people don’t talk to each other about how they’re using data \(or want to use it\). Both libraries -- CLP in particular -- have helped to address this by providing space for users to come together to talk about civic data and how they have used data in practice. The WPRDC has a need for space to convene data users and providers and an interest in connecting users with one another; the libraries have space and core goals around facilitating access and use of information. The libraries’ relationship with the WPRDC has resulted in data and GIS-focused programming for libraries’ users and additional reach for the WPRDC.
