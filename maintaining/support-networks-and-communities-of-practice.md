# Support Networks and Communities of Practice

In this guide, we've talked a lot about the community you work with locally: the people in your town, city, or region. But through your work, you are also part of other communities, distributed around the country and the world. These are groups of people -- whether library workers, data intermediaries, or others interested in aspects of civic data -- who form support networks and communities of practice. Library roles around local civic data are still emerging and evolving. Leaning on support networks for advice, examples, and inspiration can help you to maintain your work.

The Civic Switchboard project was designed, in part, to help facilitate a community of practice among people working to connect libraries with civic data in their local communities. We've hosted workshops and conference calls, written blog posts, and are working to get an online discussion group started. But in this part of our guide, we'd like to highlight some other relevant networks and communities you may wish to connect with.
