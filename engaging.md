## About this Section

An aim of this project is to support libraries and data intermediaries as they establish relationships and this is the focus of the guide section, _Engaging_. In this section, we identify potential civic data partners for libraries to engage and offer guidance on how to talk with your organization about the relevancy and value of civic data work.
