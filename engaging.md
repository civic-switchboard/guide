## About this Section

An aim of this project is to support libraries and data intermediaries as they establish relationships and this is the focus of the guide section, _Engaging_. In this section, we identify potential civic data partners for libraries to engage, defining the term "data intermediary" and the type of organizations and groups that play this role.
