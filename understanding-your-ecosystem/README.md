# Understanding Your Ecosystem

The previous section, _Engaging Partners_, hopefully helped you to identify and establish relationships with other data intermediaries and participants in your local context. This section, _Understanding Your Ecosystem,_ will help you to build on those relationships to understand the unique characteristics of your own civic data ecosystem. In this section, we'll share some techniques you can use to gain a deeper understanding what is already happening where you are. We believe this knowledge is crucial, and should be developed before taking actions described in the following section, _Library Roles_.
