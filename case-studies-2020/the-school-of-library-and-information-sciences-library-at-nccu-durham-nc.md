**While the history of redlining and its impact on American cities is increasingly well-known, the similarly widespread practice of encoding racially restrictive covenant clauses on property deeds has received significantly less attention. Faculty at The School of Library and Information Sciences partnered with community organizations and residents to collect transcriptions of racially restrictive covenants. One important finding was about process: the project team learned early on that they would need help facilitating community meetings to make sure they addressed the emotional effects of reading the restrictive language in the deeds. This project demonstrates that libraries (in this case, researchers within Library & Information Science) can serve a lead role in engaging with local stakeholders on public records information.**

Historical property deeds of Durham County, North Carolina are public records that tell the story and impact of racially restrictive agreements contained therein. One of our project team members, Alexandra Chassanoff, faculty at The School of Library and Information Sciences (SLIS) Library at North Carolina Central University partnered with DataWorks NC and The Durham County Register of Deeds to engage citizens of Durham county, and interested parties, to build an online collection of transcriptions of these racially restrictive covenants. As the project took place, we also gained the expertise of a community facilitator and local attorney.\
Our goals for this project were:&#x20;

* To inform community members about the history of exclusionary zoning restrictions in Durham,
* To provide context for the city’s current affordable housing crisis, and&#x20;
* To empower community participation in translation efforts and analysis of legacy documentation, turning handwritten documentation into human and machine-readable “data,” making it searchable and accessible, and facilitating future GIS work linking deeds to plats

In order to obtain the records in a viable format the data management software provider for the Register of Deeds was contacted in order to request the necessary records in PDF format, which they were able to provide. Originally, the project planned to hold in-person workshops, training, and events. We made the switch to online sessions to accommodate restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

We have held nine workshops to date - training volunteers to review deeds for the presence of racial covenants and participate in transcription work. Most have been public but a few have been with “affinity groups” in Durham such as Legal Aid.&#x20;

The Library School was active in organizing the events, conducting research, and creating and testing workflows for crowdsourcing transcriptions. DataWorks and The City of Durham directed outreach efforts, managed the data conversion process, and helped publicize our public workshops.

It was a challenge to evaluate the experiences of volunteers transcribing and interacting with sensitive data. Our team met to discuss our experience in transcribing racial covenants. Each member expressed emotional effects of reading the restrictive language in property deed that made it forbidden for occupants from selling, giving, or allowing people of African descent from living or working on property. A local community activist, led our group at our Civic Engagement Events through a guided visualization exercise where participants were able to be in a “Safe Space” to examine the emotions that emerged from working with the property deeds.&#x20;

> Feedback from one member after an event: _".... the \[event] held today was so powerful - reading the hateful language embedded into so many documents, talking about them with other community members, thinking & learning together."_&#x20;

Having a technically and professionally diverse group allowed for a tremendous range of perspectives to be considered in the creation of the public facing elements of the project which only strengthened the product. A number of the organizations represented on the project team already had strong organizing ties within communities in Durham from previous engagement on issues ranging from public health equity to citizen satisfaction. Project partners had worked together previously which helped lay the groundwork for portions of this project.&#x20;

Our project demonstrates that libraries can serve as a central organizational hub for working with different local entities on engagement with public records information that demonstrate histories. It provides an example for other communities and cities that want to support the work of more equitable housing practices and the aims of housing justice overall. Moving forward, we are well-prepared to accomplish the following activities:

* Community outreach to groups interested in housing justice
* Future transcription workshops with community members&#x20;
* Networking with other housing justice advocates to advance initiatives focused on housing reparations.
